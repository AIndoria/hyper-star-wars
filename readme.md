## Description

## Install

### Using the plugin manager - `hpm-cli`

Firstly, ensure you have [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/releases) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed in your system.<br/>
Then simply do the `npm` dance to get `hpm-cli`

```bash
# fire up a terminal and type
$ npm install -g hpm-cli
```

Once done with that, it's time to install the `hyper-star-wars` theme!

```bash
# run the hyper plugin manager
$ hpm install hyper-star-wars
```

### Manually through `.hyper.js`

Add `hyper-star-wars` to the plugins list in your `~/.hyper.js` config file and restart Hyper.
That's it!

```js
plugins: ['hyper-star-wars']
```
